## A little about Me

I'm an IT & Cybersecurity student with a strong hands on mindset and a degree in .NET development. 
Most of my time is spent in labs, CTF challenges and homelab environments  
analyzing traffic, decoding hidden data, testing network security and understanding how real attacks work.
My background in .NET development has given me a solid foundation in application architecture, backend logic
and a deep understanding of how systems are built and of course how they break.

I’m persistent, curious, and thrive when things don’t work the first time.  
That’s usually where the real learning begins.

## Did i mention i loooove hacking?

## What I’m working on right now

- Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges  
  - Network traffic analysis (PCAP, UDP/TCP, protocols)  
  - Steganography, crypto & hidden data  

- Network & Infrastructure Security  
  - VLANs, ACLs, segmentation & routing  
  - Understanding how networks fail and how to defend them  

- Linux & CLI  
  - Scripting, tooling and automation  
  - Living in the terminal (by choice)

- Homelab experiments  
  - Security testing & monitoring  
  - Learning by building and breaking my own systems


## My Goal

Become a highly skilled white-hat hacker with strong foundations in both  
Red Team techniques** and **Blue Team defense.
